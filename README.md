# Scene-Recognition-Using-Image-Processing-Techniques-in-Python
This project focuses on developing a scene recognition system using Python and OpenCV. The aim is to classify images of different scenes—such as beaches, mountains, restaurants, and roads—by leveraging various image processing techniques, including histograms, color moments, texture features, and contours.
